------ Initial README file -------

Files in musicHub include:
cubes.html
waves.html
circles.html

Cubes.html:
A three.js 3D environment, cubes being printed out and re-sizing depending on the music that is being played. 

Buggs: First release buggs are that only one row of cubes resize on music parsing, rest remain same size.

Waves.html:
A three.js environment showing multiple circles printed out into rows which increase and decrease to the music

Bars.html:
Another three.js environment displaying small cubes scaling to the music that is being plated.

Further Notes:
These files are only the code for the three.js and web gl animations part of my application. The parsing on the music is done in a seperate js file that has not been uploaded yet.
