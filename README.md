------ Initial README file -------

Files in musicHub include:
cubes.html
waves.html
circles.html

Cubes.html:
A three.js 3D environment, cubes being printed out and re-sizing depending on the music that is being played. 

Buggs: First release buggs are that only one row of cubes resize on music parsing, rest remain same size.

Waves.html:
A three.js environment showing multiple circles printed out into rows which increase and decrease to the music

Bars.html:
Another three.js environment displaying small cubes scaling to the music that is being plated.

Further Notes:
These files are only the code for the three.js and web gl animations part of my application. The parsing on the music is done in a seperate js file that has not been uploaded yet.

Processing.js:
I was thinking recently about all the different Javascript libraries that are currently knocking around. I thought that I'd have a look into some of them to see if they would be able to aid me in what I'm trying to achieve with my dissertation. Which at the minute is quite a vauge idea of parsing audio in the browser and displaying this data into some sort of visualisation.

So this has lead me into finding this lovely JS library called processing.js. Which to be honest seems to be the perfect tool to be able to help me with what I'm trying to achieve. 

processing/lines.js -
This file simply generates some lines and displayes them out into a canvas. Also has some circles that are displayed according to the mouse position on the canvas. Just a simple little web app to get started with Processing.js and get a feel of it's abilities.

processing/visual.js -
